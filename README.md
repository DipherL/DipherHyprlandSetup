# DipherHyprlandSetup
My personal hyprland + arch setup!

Hi!

This is probably more a personal setup so things might not be explained too well as i'm only writing this for myself to be honest but hopefully by the small chance anyone comes across this it should be straight foward!

First install yay: ./InstallYay.sh
    Then, Install all packages needed using: ./packages.sh

Then move the config files to ~/.config

# For Waypaper - config.ini
matugen --show-colors -t scheme-content image $wallpaper
